If you wish to use these with RISCW32, you may wish to create a 32-bit 
sub-folder and save the old 32-bit risc.exe and SDL2.dll in it.

Use risc.exe if you are not running under MSYS2 and you wish to see console 
output, such as usage, LEDs, asserts etc.

Use riscw.exe if you are launching the emulator from an icon/shortcut and
you do not wish to create a console window.
